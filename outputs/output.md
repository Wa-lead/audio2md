# Five Lines of Code by Christian Clausen

In the book *Five Lines of Code* by Christian Clausen, the author presents a series of rules and guidelines aimed at improving code quality and making it easier to work with. As the editor of *97 Things Every Program Should Know* and *97 Things Every Java Program Should Know*, Clausen is familiar with books that have hard-coded numbers in their titles.

During his time in university, Clausen became increasingly interested in the concept of perfect code that is resilient to change. He wanted to find ways to make code easier to work with and started experimenting with small rules and principles that could enhance code quality. These rules gradually built upon each other and resulted in significant improvements.

Impressed by the positive outcomes, Clausen decided to compile his rules into a catalog of best practices. Initially, the book was meant to be just 100 pages long, focusing on small incremental changes to messy codebases. This approach is particularly valuable because messy codebases are a common reality in software development, whether inherited from others or even projects one has worked on in the past.

What sets *Five Lines of Code* apart is that it provides readers with raw recipes and low-level ingredients, focusing on the code itself rather than relying heavily on specific tools. Clausen believes in the purity of understanding the least amount of things needed to work effectively. While tools can be helpful in accelerating processes, they can also introduce complications and risks.

The book emphasizes that code is a representation of reality in a language that computers and humans can comprehend. Therefore, it is essential to consider the lowest common denominator between humans and machines when crafting code. In software development, there has been a tendency to erect barriers to communication. However, *Five Lines of Code* encourages more effective communication through better naming, structuring, and articulation of code goals.

Notably, the book aims to make code more immediately visible and comprehensible. Clausen believes that code should be easily evaluated as either correct or incorrect without much cognitive effort. With numerous tasks on developers' backlogs, the ability to quickly evaluate code quality becomes crucial. As a result, the book promotes minimizing the use of comments to ensure that the ones present are meaningful and read by developers.

The book also touches on the difference in approach between functional programmers and other developers. Functional programmers often spend more time thinking and planning before writing code. Clausen compares refactoring to deformatting a computer, where accumulated knowledge needs to be tidied up and consolidated to reflect the current truth of the codebase.

In conclusion, *Five Lines of Code* offers a collection of rules, principles, and techniques to improve code quality and make it more manageable. Clausen's approach focuses on incremental changes to messy codebases and prioritizes effective communication and immediate code visibility. By using the book's insights, developers can enhance their understanding of code and work more efficiently.
